# Online MASM32 Educational Simulator

Static browser-based educational simulator for small MASM32/Irvine32-style console programs. The project uses a C99 MASM-like parser plus an internal virtual machine compiled to WebAssembly with Emscripten, then runs through a JavaScript browser UI and Web Worker.

## Current status

Repository/archive milestone:
Phase 61B - Branch Runtime Watchdog Scope Cleanup

Runtime/source-run MASM behavior phase:
Phase 61 - Direct JMP Runtime Execution

Status interpretation:
The repository/archive milestone is newer than the runtime/source-run MASM behavior phase because Phase 61B clarifies documentation and static checks for behavior already owned by Phase 61. It does not add MASM syntax, parser behavior, VM behavior, executor behavior, Wasm API behavior, browser controls, browser layout, browser interaction behavior, diagnostic codes, diagnostic JSON fields, or rendered Simulator Messages behavior.

Phase 61 executes already-lowered direct `jmp label` forms that target executable code labels or procedure-entry labels. A direct `jmp` transfers to the resolved VM instruction index, counts as one executed instruction, preserves modeled flags, produces no memory-change row, and respects the Phase 59 `instructionLimit` watchdog, which still reports `instruction-limit-exceeded` when a configured limit blocks the next instruction. Phase 61B clarifies that this is an instruction-count watchdog boundary only. Active-time watchdog behavior is not part of Phase 61, Phase 61A, or Phase 61B; it remains future work owned by Phase 200 - Active Time Watchdog and Worker Responsiveness. Conditional jumps, `loop`, indirect jumps, register-target jumps, memory-target jumps, immediate-target jumps, `call`, `ret`, stack behavior, procedure invocation, branch-distance/type overrides, debugger stepping, breakpoints, and UI label navigation remain future work.

## Current simulator scope

The current runtime supports the MASM32 Educational Mode subset documented in [`docs/SUPPORTED_SYNTAX.md`](docs/SUPPORTED_SYNTAX.md): selected data sections, MASM compatibility directives, operands, arithmetic/logic/shift/rotate/multiply/divide instructions, code-label metadata, direct JMP runtime execution, instruction-count limits, diagnostic settings, startup notices, display markers, unsupported-feature diagnostics, and the virtual Irvine32 `exit` terminator.

For exact accepted forms, rejected forms, diagnostics, and runtime-phase status, use [`docs/SUPPORTED_SYNTAX.md`](docs/SUPPORTED_SYNTAX.md) instead of this README.

## Quick start

Serve the browser app over local HTTP:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory web
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

Run aggregate verification:

```sh
python3 scripts/run_tests.py --all
```

Build WebAssembly artifacts when Emscripten `emcc` is available:

```sh
./scripts/build_wasm.sh
```

For detailed setup, Windows command files, Visual Studio notes, missing-`emcc` troubleshooting, focused test groups, and browser/Wasm smoke guidance, see [`docs/BUILDING_AND_DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/BUILDING_AND_DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Project boundaries

This project is:

- a static browser application;
- a C99 MASM-like parser plus internal VM compiled to WebAssembly;
- an educational MASM32/Irvine32-style console simulator.

This project is not:

- a full MASM compiler;
- a full x86 emulator;
- a Windows emulator;
- a PE loader or linker;
- a WinAPI simulator;
- a host include loader or full macro assembler.

Keep simulator execution in the Web Worker, keep core modules in C99 `.c` and `.h` files, and use the canonical specification and implementation guide for implementation decisions.
