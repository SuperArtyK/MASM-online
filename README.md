# Online MASM32 Educational Simulator

Static browser-based educational simulator for small MASM32/Irvine32-style console programs. The project uses a C99 MASM-like parser plus an internal virtual machine compiled to WebAssembly with Emscripten, then runs through a JavaScript browser UI and Web Worker.

## Current status

Repository/archive milestone:
Phase 57D - Existing Diagnostic Policy Migration

Runtime/source-run MASM behavior phase:
Phase 57 - Signed IDIV

Phase 57D is backend diagnostic-policy migration work only. It routes existing configurable diagnostic families through the shared registry or compatibility adapters while preserving user-visible defaults and keeping runtime/source-run MASM behavior at Phase 57 - Signed IDIV.

## Current simulator scope

The current runtime supports the MASM32 Educational Mode subset documented in [`docs/SUPPORTED_SYNTAX.md`](docs/SUPPORTED_SYNTAX.md). In broad terms, that includes the C99 core VM/parser/executor, checked simulated memory, `.data`, `.DATA?`, `.CONST`, selected MASM compatibility directives, selected register and memory operands, selected arithmetic/logic/shift/rotate/multiply/divide instructions through signed `idiv`, diagnostic settings, and the virtual Irvine32 `exit` terminator.

For exact accepted forms, rejected forms, diagnostics, and runtime-phase status, use [`docs/SUPPORTED_SYNTAX.md`](docs/SUPPORTED_SYNTAX.md) instead of this README.

## Quick start

Serve the browser app over local HTTP:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory web
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

Run aggregate verification:

```sh
python3 scripts/run_tests.py --all
```

Build WebAssembly artifacts when Emscripten `emcc` is available:

```sh
./scripts/build_wasm.sh
```

For detailed setup, Windows command files, Visual Studio notes, missing-`emcc` troubleshooting, focused test groups, and browser/Wasm smoke guidance, see [`docs/BUILDING_AND_DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/BUILDING_AND_DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Project boundaries

This project is:

- a static browser application;
- a C99 MASM-like parser plus internal VM compiled to WebAssembly;
- an educational MASM32/Irvine32-style console simulator.

This project is not:

- a full MASM compiler;
- a full x86 emulator;
- a Windows emulator;
- a PE loader or linker;
- a WinAPI simulator;
- a host include loader or full macro assembler.

Keep simulator execution in the Web Worker, keep core modules in C99 `.c` and `.h` files, and use the canonical specification and implementation guide for implementation decisions.
